            Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high,
Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
How I wonder what you are.

When the blazing sun is gone,
When he nothing shines upon,
Then you show your little light,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Then the traveler in the dark,
Thanks you for your tiny spark,
He could not see which way to go,
If you did not twinkle so.

In the dark blue sky you keep,
And often through my curtains peep,
For you never shut your eye,
Till the sun is in the sky.

As your bright and tiny spark,
Lights the traveler in the dark.
Though I know not what you are,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

            Open, shut them, open shut them,
Give a little clap, clap, clap.
Open, shut them, open, shut them,
Lay them in your lap, lap, lap.

Creep them, creep them, slowly creep them,
to your little chin chinchin.
Open up your little mouth,
But do not let them in, in, in.

Open, shut them, open shut them,
To your shoulders fly.
Then like the little birdies,
Let them flutter to the sky.

            I am dancing around with my rainbow colors
Dancing around and around
I am dancing around with my rainbow colors
Dancing around and around.
I can reach up high and twirl them around,
Then twirl them slowly to the ground
I am dancing around with my rainbow colors
Dancing around and around.
I am jumping up and down with my rainbow colors
Jumping, jumping up and down
I am jumping up and down with my rainbow colors
Jumping, jumping up and down.
I am swaying back and forth with my rainbow colors
Making and rainbow in the sky
I am swaying back and forth with my rainbow colors
Making a rainbow in the sky.

            London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down,
London Bridge is falling down, my fair lady.

Build it up with wood and clay, wood and clay, wood and clay,
Build it up with wood and clay, my fair lady.

Wood and clay will wash away, wash away, wash away,
Wood and clay will wash away, my fair lady.

Build it up with bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar, bricks and mortar,
Build it up with bricks and mortar, my fair lady.

Bricks and mortar will not stay, will not stay, will not stay,
Bricks and mortar will not stay, my fair lady.

Build it up with silver and gold, silver and gold, silver and gold,
Build it up with silver and gold, my fair lady.
