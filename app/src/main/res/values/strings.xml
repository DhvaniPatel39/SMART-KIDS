            I have a little doggy, his paws are really big
And when he goes outside he likes to dig and dig and dig
He drops his bone into the hole and covers it in a snap
Puts one paw on the other then lies down to take a nap.

            Head and shoulders, knees and toes,
Head and shoulders, knees and toes.
Eyes and ears and mouth and nose,
Head and shoulders, knees and toes.

            Do your ears hang low,
Do they wobble to and fro
Can you tie them in a knot,
Can you tie them in a bow
Can you throw them over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier
Do you ears hang low.

            Little Miss Muffet,
Sat on a tuffet,
Eating her curds and whey
When along came a spider
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

            The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout
Down came the rain and washed the spider out
Out came the sun and it dried up all the rain
Then the itsy bitsy spider went up the spout again.
